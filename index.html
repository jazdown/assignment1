        <p class="dropcap" class="bodyinfo">Japanese origami began sometime after Buddhist monks carried paper to Japan during the 6
            <sup>th</sup>century. The first Japanese origami is dated from this period and was used for religious ceremonial purposes only, due to the high price of paper.</p>

        <p class="bodyinfo">The Japanese word
            <em>origami</em>itself is a compound of two smaller Japanese words:
            <em>ori</em>, meaning to fold, and
            <em>kami</em>, meaning paper. Until recently, all forms of paper folding were not grouped under the word origami, namely
            <em>tsutsumi</em>, a kind of wrapper used for formal occasions. Before that, paperfolding for play was known by a variety of names, including
            <em>orikata, orisue, orimono, tatamigami</em>and others. Exactly why
            <em>origami</em>became the common name is not known; it has been suggested that the word was adopted in the kindergartens because the written characters were easier for young children to write. Another theory is that the word
            <em>origami</em>was a direct translation of the German word
            <em>Papierfalten</em>, brought into Japan with the Kindergarten Movement around 1880.</p>

        <p class="bodyinfo">One of the most famous origami designs is the Japanese crane. The crane is auspicious in Japanese culture. Legend says that anyone who folds one thousand paper cranes will have their heart's desire come true. The origami crane has become a symbol of peace because of this belief and because of a young Japanese girl named Sadako Sasaki. Sadako was exposed to the radiation of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as an infant, and it took its inevitable toll on her health. She was then a hibakusha — an atom bomb survivor. By the time she was twelve in 1955, she was dying of leukemia. Hearing the legend, she decided to fold one thousand origami cranes so that she could live. However, when she saw that the other children in her ward were dying, she realized that she would not survive and wished instead for world peace and an end to suffering. A popular version of the tale is that Sadako folded 644 cranes before she died; her classmates then continued folding cranes in honor of their friend. She was buried with a wreath of 1,000 cranes to honor her dream. While her effort could not extend her life, it moved her friends to make a granite statue of Sadako in the Hiroshima Peace Park: a girl standing with her hands outstretched, a paper crane flying from her fingertips. Every year the statue is adorned with thousands of wreaths of a thousand origami cranes. A group of one thousand paper cranes is called senbazuru in Japanese. The tale of Sadako has been dramatized in many books and movies.</p>
